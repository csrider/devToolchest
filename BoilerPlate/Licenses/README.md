# About

I whipped this up just to take out some tedium from applying software licenses to my projects.

These are full-text license files to act as templates and include in your projects. Each license file has basic information, instructions, and header boilerplate for your source-code files, along with a summary and details about what the license allows, restricts, etc.

When you copy a file to your project, be sure to follow the comments (and delete the top parts before release).

# Shell Scripts

In addition to the template licenses, I've created a bash script to customize the boilerplace (e.g. to update the copyright info) with current year, your name, and email). The intention is for you to run the script, then use the generated license file for your project (details are provided in the output directory's readme file). The script itself will guide you through the simple process.

Additional scripts may come in later versions.
