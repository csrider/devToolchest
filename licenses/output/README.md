This is the directory where license boilerplate is output to by the generateBoilerplate script.

When the script generates your boilerplate, the LICENSE file will contain all you need to apply the license to your software (i.e. instructions, full-license file, and source-code file header boilerplate). Follow whatever the license's instructions in that file advise; but basically you'd copy the file to the root of your project, and pull out the header boilerplate for your source files.
