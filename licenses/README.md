# About

These are full-text license files to include in your project. Each file has basic information, instructions, and header boilerplate for your source-code files, along with a summary and details about what the license allows, restricts, etc.

# Dynamic Info / Shell Scripts

In addition , I've created a bash script to customize the boilerplace (e.g. copyright info) with current year, your name, and email. The intention is for you to run the script, then use the generated license file for your project (details are provided in the output directory's readme file).

Additional scripts may come in later versions.
