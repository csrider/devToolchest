# About devToolchest 🛠

This repo is where I dump all of my tools, scripts, boilerplate, and other repeated tedium... whether that be code snippets, licensing, automation, or other stuff. I have a ton of tools that I'll slowly be putting into this repo as I use them. If you find them useful, then enjoy.

And yeah, I could've used a snippet manager or Gists for some of what's in here (and I may someday), but a vanilla Git repo of just all development tools just feels so much more pure, doesn't it? 😁
