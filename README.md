# About

This repo is where I dump all my repeated tedium... whether that be code snippets, licensing, or other stuff.

Yeah, I could've used a snippet manager or Gists (and I may someday), but a vanilla Git repo just feels so much more pure, doesn't it? üòÅ

# License

*And since I often like to eat my own dogfood...*
